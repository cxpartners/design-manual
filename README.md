# cx Design Manual

This is a GitHub pages repository for the [**cx Design Manual**](http://cxdesignmanual.com).

This project was ideated, designed, and developed by [Chris Berridge](http://www.cxpartners.co.uk/who-we-are/chris-berridge/), [Luke Jones](http://www.cxpartners.co.uk/who-we-are/luke-jones/), [Michelle O’Loughlin](http://www.cxpartners.co.uk/who-we-are/michelle-oloughlin/), and [Yunmie Kim](http://www.cxpartners.co.uk/who-we-are/yunmie-kim/) during the first cx Visual Design Summit in August 2014.

If you wish to make an update to the assets, content, or design of this project, please contact a member of the design department.

## To-do list

* ‘How to write cxpartners’, cx vs. CX / cxpartners vs. CX Partners, etc.
* Move all .zip files to a content delivery network
* An introduction page / table of contents
* Examples on how to use colour
* Basics of typography and the principles of typesetting (e.g. Gestalt theory)
* Provide ideas on how to use images in presentations and other scenarios
* Individual image downloads (for the image library)
* Make embedded images retina (excluding logo)

## Additional info

Generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), with CSS pre-processing through [LESS](http://lesscss.org/).

This site was designed and built to suit the environments which cxpartners employees work in. That means it is not responsive or fluid, and has only been browser-tested in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. We discussed the use case and decided that this manual will most likely be read in a production environment where assets can be used and downloaded. Not on a tablet or mobile phone.
