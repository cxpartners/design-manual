      <h2>Your signature</h2>
      <p>Your signature should be short and give all the information the reader needs: your name, what you do, how to contact you, and any further info (through a link to the cxpartners website).</p>
      <p>Additional information such as blog posts, Sykpe details, or twitter usernames can be put in your signature, but prioritise this additional information so the signature is in a logical order.</p>
      <p>The addresses and small-print at the bottom of the signature are a legal requirement in the United Kingdom, so please do not remove these.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Copy and paste one of the signature templates to the right into the email app of your choice.</p>

    <h2>Sending emails</h2>
    <div class="two-col first">
      <h3>The basics</h3>
      <p>Hereâ€™s how your emails from @cxpartners.co.uk addresses should be formatted.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use as few font sizes, weights, and colours as possible</li>
        <li>Make sure your email text and signature are consistent with these guidelines</li>
        <li>Copy and paste the signature templates from above. The type size, weights, and colour are different to set the signature back from the text of the email</li>
        <li>Do not put images or your sign-off (e.g. Kind regards, Joseph) in your signature</li>
      </ul>
    </div><!--/two-col-->
    <div class="two-col">
      <h3>Formatting your text</h3>
      <p>Your email text should be set in Arial, 13pt, Black.</p>
      <p>Arial is a system font on most devices, so it won't be substituted by an inappropriate font. If readers want smaller or larger text they can zoom in or out on their device.</p>
